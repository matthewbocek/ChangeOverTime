This code snippet was developed for a theater company's Wordpress site. 
It allows you to give a post a different presentation based on the current 
date. 

Requires Advanced Custom Fields, an excellent and free plugin from
http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/

By default, Wordpress allows you to delay the publication of a post, but
not to dynamicaly change the presentation based on the date.

For example, if you have a show scheduled to open on a certain day,
you can have it be hidden until one month before that date, then show
up as "coming soon." You don't want people to confuse it with a show
that is actually running. One week before, you could add a link to 
pre-order tickets, and on the day of, have it switch over to "Now Playing",
because the last thing you want on opening night is to worry about updating
your website. You can also specify an end date, so that when the show is
over it will show up as "closed", or even disappear from public view entirely.
